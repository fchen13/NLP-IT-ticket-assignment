# SupportTicket
The dataset contains 19,796 rows and 2 columns. The column ‘body’ represents the ticket description submitted to Microsoft IT-support desk, and the columns ‘urgency’ represents the priority of each ticket. A lot of human effort is spent to re-prioritize the incoming support tickets.

Problem statement: the goal of this project is to create a predictive model which can correlate the text content of tickets with the urgency level, and then classify incoming tickets into three priorities (P1/P2/P3). The autoclassification process is expected to reduce HR cost and increase service efficiency.
